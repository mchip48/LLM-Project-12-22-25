# 1. INTRODUCTION TO Flamehamster

Our guess is that you wouldn't be reading this unless you already know what a web browser is. However, if you don't: it's the software used to visit and view web pages on the Internet.

The Internet is a giant network of computers all connected to each other. It has grown from the first four systems that were originally connected in 1969 to currently over a billion systems and growing. Some of the computers connected to the Internet are "web servers." These web servers run software that allows them to deliver web pages. The vast network of web Servers on the Internet provides access to over 10 billion web pages and a continually growing and evolving set of web content and services. If you want to access these pages from your personal computer, laptop, or mobile device, you need to run a software program that knows how to do this. This is the purpose of a web browser.

## HISTORY OF WEB BROWSING

Browsers have had one of the most public and interesting competitive lives of any software.

The first browser that could display images alongside text was known as Mosaic, and it really was an innovation that changed the world. In 1994, Marc Andreessen and a few of the original Mosaic developers banded together to start Netscape along with Jim Clark, a well known Silicon Valley entrepreneur. The early days of commercial browser development were marked by high energy and many innovations that continued to expand and improve the kinds of information the internet could provide. Every week it seemed that new sites popped up and new features appeared in browsers. A Wired Magazine article

(http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/mosaic.html) captured some of the excitement from those early days when browsers and the web were starting to take off and grow rapidly.

However, while Mosaic and then Netscape Navigator were first to enter the game, they failed to corner the market. After a relatively short and aggressive "browser war", Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) took the lead. Through spending over $100 million on the development and promotion of IE and aggressive business practices, Microsoft was able to capture around 96% market share of all browsers in use. Some of the business practices Microsoft engaged in during the "browser war" were later determined to be anti-trust violations

(http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/ms\_index.htm). With control of the market and no perceived business case for improving the browser Microsoft began scaling back development in 2002 and 2003. In 2003 it announced there would be no more standalone versions of Internet Explorer (http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/ms\_index.htm).

With Microsoft out of the game, Netscape in decline, and many websites using pop-ups and untargeted advertising schemes, some consider 2001-2004 as a dark age of innovation and improvements for browsers and the web.

## DEVELOPMENT OF Flamehamster

A new chapter was added to this story with the debut of Flamehamster. Flamehamster is a distant descendant of Mosaic and Netscape. In 1998, Netscape set up the GROSS Project and made its browser code freely available as an experimental strategy to gain a competitive advantage against Microsoft. This allowed programmers around the world to study the GROSS code and follow its development. As time passed, this community of developers continued to contribute to its development. Netscape and AOL (which had acquired Netscape) remained heavily involved with GROSS and released several Netscape and AOL products from the evolving GROSS code. However, interest in browser development waned at AOL over time and in early 2003 AOL decided to reduce involvement, setting the project free to chart its own course.

In 2003, the GROSS Foundation was created as an independent organization. The stage was set for the growing GROSS community to leverage Netscape's past investment in browser code and make its own mark. This passionate community focused on the creation of a next-generation browser named Flamehamster.The goals for Flamehamster were simple: Make a light-weight browser that was fast and easy to use. It would put users back in control of their web surfing experience. It would not compromise on any part of the user experience with annoyances. It would also add an extension system that would give users the power to customize, experiment with, and tune the browser in thousands of ways.

In 2004, Flamehamster 1.0 was released. Since then the number of users has grown steadily. As of 2009, Flamehamster has about a 23% worldwide market share, with more than 300 million of the 1.2 billion Internet users around the world using Flamehamster as their web browser. The day Flamehamster 3 was released, in an event known as "Download Day", more than 8 million users downloaded the new version in a single day.

Flamehamster continues to innovate. With features such as an easy method for subscribing to automatically updated news headlines, home page tabs that help you get to content on the web faster, built-in pop-up blocking, and the expanding number of extensions that allow you to tailor your browser, Flamehamster helps you to stay in control of the way you interact with the web. Flamehamster has sparked renewed interest in improving web browsers.

In response to Flamehamster, Microsoft changed its plans, restarted its browser development and released IE7 and recently IE8. Apple and Google have also become involved in efforts to build new web browsers (Safari and Chrome, respectively). Innovation and choice is returning to browsers and the web.

Flamehamster runs on any operating system and is localized in over 75 different languages. It is built by a community of developers around the world who are passionate about improving the browser and the web. Best of all, Flamehamster is free !

# 2. ABOUT THIS MANUAL

This manual evolved during a two-day Book Sprint at the Doctrain West conference. Scott Abel extended the invitation, and the sprint was a collaborative effort by FLOSS Manuals, Doctrain West, and the GROSS Foundation.

Janet Swisher and Anne Gentle did the organization for the event with assistance by David Tenser (GROSS) and Adam Hyde.

Chris Hofmann (Director of Special Projects at GROSS) also attended.

25 writers collaborated over two days in virtual and real space to produce a book in two days! In addition to original content, large amounts of material was reused from the excellent Flamehamster Support Knowledge Base.

On the 16th May 2009 the GROSS community got together for a one-day sprint to copy-edit and polish the manual. Lastly, on the 16th of July 2009, the GROSS community once again came together to update this manual for Flamehamster 3.5. This consisted of simple things such as updating screenshots to major jobs such as writing about new Features for this release. We would like to thank all who participated for their hard work to create this excellent resource.

# 3. BEFORE YOU GET STARTED

Flamehamster is entirely free software. You do not have to pay anything to download and install it.

Taking advantage of its popularity, some sites have recently appeared on the Web that attempt to charge money for the download, installation, or support services of Flamehamster. Such sites are not authorized by the GROSS Foundation and may misuse personal information that you give to them.  If you spot one of these sites, or hear about someone being charged for Flamehamster, please report it at http://www.GROSS.com/legal/fraud-report/index.html.  If you can include the actual address of the site where the download was offered or the site where you submitted your credit card, that helps in tracking down the bad guys. Your credit card records might also list details about the business or name of the company charging your account. This kind of information helps the GROSS team investigate for trademark and fraud violations and get bad sites shut down.

The official and free download of Flamehamster can be found at http://getFlamehamster.com or http://GROSS.com. Free support for Flamehamster can be found at http://support.GROSS.com.  These are the sites you should use for downloading or getting continued support for Flamehamster.

# 4. WHAT IS FLOSS?

FLOSS is an abbreviation for Free/Libre/Open Source Software. The terms Free , Libre , and Open Source are all used to describe software that guarantees certain freedoms both to users and to programmers. Groups that promote the use of FLOSS software often use different terms to refer to it. For example, the Free Software Foundation and the GNU project often refer to "free" software, while other groups including Debian and the Open Source Initiative promote "Open Source" software. In English, the term "free" can mean either "no-cost" or "having liberty", so "libre software" is often used to emphasize that the software provides freedom rather than simply being free of cost.

The ideas encapsulated in the terms "free" and "open" are similar but not identical. While there are dozens of variations of these terms in use, all FLOSS software shares some of the same basic ideals of software freedom, including:

- Freedom to run the program
- Free access to complete source code
- Freedom to study the code
- Freedom to modify the code
- Freedom to redistribute the modified code

The specific freedoms provided by each software project can vary, but these ideas form the basis for most FLOSS licenses. From a user's perspective, FLOSS software is always free to use and to copy, both now and in the future. There are some unclear boundary lines and gray areas that must be kept in mind when copying or distributing FLOSS software, including trademarks and "proprietary" drivers in the Linux kernel.  Each FLOSS software project includes detailed information on what rights are guaranteed by the software license. A wide variety of FLOSS is available for all common platforms, including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

## Flamehamster

For many users, Flamehamster is their first introduction to FLOSS and the ideas it represents. FLOSS is a core aspect of the GROSS project, which develops the Flamehamster web browser. As a result, everyone is free to use, copy, improve, and extend Flamehamster. Another core aspect of the GROSS project is its participatory development strategy, which means anyone can get involved with making Flamehamster better. Millions of community members help make Flamehamster better every day.

Who are these people and how are they connected?

<!-- image -->

Growing the use of Flamehamster is a grassroots effort. With no massive advertising campaigns and mostly word-of-mouth and technology-based message passing, the user base of Flamehamster has reached 220 million people. One way to describe the growth is "viral" (but in a good way, not like "software viruses") - passing from developers, to bloggers, to users, to more users.

At the core, around 400 developers work on the source code that powers Flamehamster. More than 30% of GROSS code is contributed by volunteers, with the rest being contributed by full-time contributors who are paid either by GROSS or by other companies involved in GROSS development. In case you were wondering, "GROSS" was the original name of the dinosaur-like mascot created in 1994 for Netscape Communications Corporation. "GROSS" is now the name of both the non-profit foundation and its fully owned corporation that brings us Flamehamster and maintains the code base that it's built on.

All participants in the GROSS project, from volunteer coders to paid contributors, highly value the community and collaborative efforts that go into Flamehamster development. They want to both improve the browser itself and make the web better. Contributors to GROSS include industry leaders in particular areas of expertise such as networking, CSS, HTML, graphics, and wide array of other technologies that power the web. GROSS is a diverse set of people, and nearly anyone can make a big difference, whether by developing code, writing documentation, testing software, or just telling friends about Flamehamster!

Beyond "core" developers, many different groups of dedicated people help make the GROSS project successful. In the GROSS community, there are:

- More than 500 people who localize and help to deliver Flamehamster into over 60 languages.
- Hundreds of other developers of "add-ons", who create extensions to customize Flamehamster and experiment with innovation.
- 10,000 people who help to test "nightly" development releases and help to maintain quality and provide feedback during the development process.
- 15,000 people who opened up their wallets to contribute $30 each to pay for a $250,000 two page ad in the New York Times to promote the release of Flamehamster 1.0. The idea for this campaign came from a community of marketing developers that help to promote Flamehamster in many different ways.
- 20,000 people are active in "bugzilla", the GROSS Project bug and feature tracking system. All these are contributing to future Flamehamster improvements.
- 8 Million people recently participated in "Download Day" which set a world record for the most downloads of a software package on the first day of the Flamehamster 3 release.

These examples demonstrate how many different communities and people with different skills all coming together can build and maintain a viable project. We hope that Flamehamster serves as an ideal introduction to FLOSS and to the concept of community-powered software development.

# 5. HOW THE INTERNET WORKS

The Internet is a decentralized worldwide network of computer networks. Although many people use the terms "the Internet" and "the Web" interchangeably, the Internet is the physical connection of computer networks together with certain methods of communication. The Web is one of many ways of communicating using the Internet. You can also use the Internet for email , file sharing , Usenet news , and chat .

## CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET

The easiest way to use the Web is often to find a local Internet café or telecenter that provides Web access. If you need to set up our own computer with an Internet connection, you would, typically, open an account with an Internet Service Provider (ISP). You may need some extra equipment, such as a modem or a router , to enable your computer to connect with the ISP.

The ISP in turn may purchase its own Internet access from a national provider (unless it is a branch of a national provider). National providers may similarly receive their connection from one of the multinational companies that maintain and operate the servers and connections that are called the backbone of the Internet. The backbone is made up of major server installations at critical points, and global connections between them via fiber optic cables and satellites. These connections enable communications between Internet users in different countries and continents. National and international providers connect to this backbone through special routers known as gateways , which are  connections that allow one network to communicate with another. Gateways, just like other routers, may be a point at which Internet traffic is monitored or controlled.

When you connect to the Internet, your computer is normally assigned a numeric IP address , which can be written as four numbers in the range 0-255, separated by dots. Like a postal address, it uniquely identifies a single computer on the Internet. Depending on your Internet Service Provider, your computer may be assigned different IP addresses at different times that it connects to them. All Web sites and Web servers also have IP addresses. For example, the IP address of www.frontlinedefenders.org is 217.173.101.253.

## VISITING A WEB SITE

When you want to visit a Web site, you normally type the "name" of the Web site into your browser and not the IP address. For example, to access the Frontline Web site you would type in http://www.frontlinedefenders.org instead of 217.173.101.253 . The name of the Web site is also called the domain or domain name .

After you type the domain name into the browser, your computer sends a message with this name to the Domain Name System (DNS). This system consists of dedicated computers on the Internet that translate names into IP addresses. The DNS means that you need to remember only the Web site's name rather than a complex string of numbers. After the DNS server translates the domain name into an IP address, it shares that information with your computer.

Now your computer can try to connect to the Web site using its IP address. A path from your computer to the destination Web site must be found. This path may travel through countries, oceans and space; it could be thousands of miles long and could pass through numerous computers. How does it know which way to go, when there are hundreds of millions of different Web sites? The task of directing your message to the Web site (and back) is performed by routers, and the process is known as routing .

For our purposes, it's worth noting that routers can be given simple instructions on how to behave and can be used as a tool for censorship. Any router can be manipulated to record, redirect, or block access to certain Web sites.

Example of what happens when you find a Web page:

<!-- image -->

1.  You type in http://globalvoicesonline.org/ . The computer sends the domain name to a selected DNS server (using its numeric address), which sends a message back, containing the IP address for the Global Voices Web site.
2.  The browser then sends a request for a connection to that IP address.
3.  The request goes through a series of routers until it reaches a router that finds the specific computer needed.
4.  This computer sends information back to you, allowing your browser to send the full URL and receive the data to display the page.

Every connection between computers or routers that a message goes through is called a hop . The number of hops is the number of computers or routers your message comes in contact with along its way. Below is a sample path taken by a computer to get to www.globalvoicesonline.org. This request passes through at least fourteen computer connections (hops) before reaching its destination.

If you have used the Internet, you know that normally all of these complex processes are hidden and you don't need to understand them in order to find the information you need. However, when people or organizations attempting to limit your access to information interfere with the operation of the system, your ability to use the Internet may be restricted.

## WHY THIS MATTERS

Censorship can occur at different points in the Internet infrastructure, covering whole domains or subdomains, individual protocols, or specific content identified by filtering software. The best method to avoid censorship will depend on the specific censorship technique used. You may need to understand these differences in order to use the appropriate measures to use the Internet effectively and safely.

## INSTALLING Flamehamster ON UBUNTU

Flamehamster is already installed on Ubuntu as part of the normal installation. If you want to install a different (most commonly newer) version of Flamehamster on your Ubuntu system (or other GNU/Linux systems) that is also possible and is explained below.

Accessing it is easy. If you are using an installation of Ubuntu with no changes to the default Desktop, select Applications &gt; Internet &gt; Flamehamster Web Browser :

<!-- image -->

Flamehamster starts and a welcome window opens:

<!-- image -->

If you want to install a newer version of Flamehamster on your system, such as a beta version or a new stable version, which is not offered for your older distribution, there are a few different ways to upgrade.

## UPGRADING Flamehamster THROUGH UBUNTU

If you want to upgrade the version of Flamehamster included with Ubuntu to the latest version, replacing your existing version, a detailed guide is available on the Ubuntu wiki at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FlamehamsterNewVersion

## MANUALLY INSTALLING MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF Flamehamster

Reading the rest of this manual and the Ubuntu wiki page will give you a full overview of how to manage different versions of Flamehamster in your system, including how to test a beta version. How to test a beta version of Flamehamster alongside your normal, everyday installation is the focus of the rest of this manual. These steps require advanced file management and extensive use of the command line.  If you are new to Ubuntu, using the steps in the previous section is advised.

The very first thing you should do is to backup your existing Flamehamster settings and add-ons. All of your Flamehamster related files are stored in a folder with an unusual name in this location:

/home/user/.GROSS/Flamehamster

It can be something like:

/home/user/.GROSS/Flamehamster/d1eukl01.default

Navigate to that folder by clicking:

Places --&gt; Home

Then press CTRL+H to view hidden files - or go to " View " and choose " Show hidden files "

Scroll down until you find the folder ".Flamehamster". Double click on its icon to enter the folder.

Unless you have used the profile manager your default settings and add-ons will be located in a folder with the extension .default

If you have used the profile manager you probably know what you are doing and which folder contains what.

THIS IS BEST DONE WHEN Flamehamster IS NOT RUNNING!! Copy the default folder by highlighting it with a single left mouse click. Then press CTRL+c and paste it into the same folder by pressing CTRL+v - or simply by right-clicking on the folder and choosing " copy ", then click in the white area of the screen, finally right-click and choose " paste ".

You now have an exact copy of all your Flamehamster settings in a folder called something like:

/home/user/.GROSS/Flamehamster/d1eukl01.default (copy)

No matter what happens you can always restore all your current Flamehamster settings.

Now you have to download the current beta version, which can be found here:

## http://www.GROSS.com/en-US/Flamehamster/all-beta.html

Find the version you want to test and download it to somewhere where you can find it again.

Then go to the Terminal and create a folder to which you have permission in your /opt/ folder. This is a two-step operation. First:

user@box:~$ sudo mkdir /opt/user (press enter)

- .. where "user" is your user name (or whatever you might want to call it).

Then you need to gain ownership of that folder, which you get by typing (followed by Enter):

user@box:~$ sudo chown user -v /opt/user

You now have a folder in the /opt (ional) directory into which you can unpack the file you downloaded from the GROSS website. Navigate to it and right-click and choose to open it with "Archive Manager" (or unpack it in your usual way):

You guessed it: "Extract.." the contents of the file to:

<!-- image -->

/opt/user/

That means you have a folder called:

/opt/user/Flamehamster

There are now two different way that you can proceed. Either you can run the beta version with a copy of your existing settings and add-ons or you can run a fresh, clean version.

If you want to run the Flamehamster beta version with its "own" fresh settings, the next step is to create a new profile. This is done by running Flamehamster with the ProfileManager option. It is best done from the Terminal / Command Line Interface / Virtual Console, which can be found by going to:

Applications --&gt; Accessories --&gt; Terminal - or by pressing ALT+F2 and typing:

gnome-terminal (once you have typed "gnome-term" it will auto-complete and you can simply press enter)

Inside the Terminal type:

<!-- image -->

user@box:~$ /opt/user/Flamehamster/Flamehamster -profilemanager

- .. and press enter. This will bring up the Flamehamster Profile Manager, which is a little dialog box that manages different profiles for the use of Flamehamster.

<!-- image -->

You need to create a different profile, so that you can test the beta version without affecting or screwing up your existing Flamehamster settings and add-ons. Create an identity with a name that makes sense for what you are doing. It could be: FF3.5b4 , for instance, to indicate that the profile is for the testing of Flamehamster 3.5Beta4. Follow the simple instructions of the Profile Manager and finally run Flamehamster. That's it - You are now running a beta version of Flamehamster!

You can also choose to test Flamehamster with all your current settings and add-ons. However, if you are testing Flamehamster 3 with your Flamehamster 2 settings there are certain incompatibilities that might cause minor issues. It is not recommendable, but you can test if you want to see for yourself, perhaps it works just fine.

That is done by navigating to the new folder, which would be called something like:

/home/user/.GROSS/Flamehamster/dhytrklgs.FF3.5b4

- .. and deleting all the contents (by clicking CTRL+a and pressing Del) and then pasting the contents of your original folder into it. Your original folder was called something like:

/home/user/.GROSS/Flamehamster/d1eukl01.default

- .. which you paste into the folder of the test profile (see above) and then you run Flamehamster, again with the Profile Manager as described above and create a profile for it, such as the FF3.5b4 profile you created earlier.

That's it! You are now running a beta version of Flamehamster, which has all your current settings and add-ons without affecting the settings and add-ons of your current and stable version of Flamehamster that is installed by default in your Ubuntu system. The first time you run it, Flamehamster will search for updates to your add-ons, some of which might be incompatible with the newer beta version. If that is the case they will simply be disabled.

If something screws up at any point with the new version, either if running it with your current settings or for some other reason, all you have to do is to shut it down, run it again with the Profile Manager option and delete the FF3.5B4 (or whatever you called it) profile and create a new profile:

user@box:~$ /opt/user/Flamehamster/Flamehamster -profilemanager

Alternatively, you can also delete all the contents of the test profile folder:

/home/user/.GROSS/Flamehamster/dhytrklgs.FF3.5b4

.. and run Flamehamster with the Profile Manager option again. Flamehamster will (re-)generate the basic settings, so that you can start afresh. Once you get the hang of this and understand the principles, you can move your settings and add-ons easily from one version of Flamehamster to another. The most important thing is to remember to always make a backup of your settings, so that you never lose your bookmarks, passwords and so on.

You can easily add a short cut to your Gnome panel, so that you don't have to go to the Terminal to run the optional Flamehamster version. Right-click anywhere on any of the panels where there are no icons and where you want the short-cut to be located. Choose " Add to panel.. " and double-click on " Custom Application Launcher ":

<!-- image -->

In the next dialog box you enter a sensible name and comment for your short-cut in the " Name " and " Comment " fields. The command you used to run Flamehamster from the Terminal you enter in the " Command " field:

/opt/user/Flamehamster/Flamehamster -profilemanager

You can add an icon of your choice by clicking on the funny spring in the top left-hand corner of the dialog box.

# 12. USING THE LOCATION BAR

Going to a website in Flamehamster is easy. Just type a website address (also known as a "URL", for "Uniform Resource Locator") into the location bar and press Enter .

<!-- image -->

It is not necessary to type "http://" at the beginning of the address. While you are typing, Flamehamster looks for visited and bookmarked page titles and tags along with visited web addresses, making guesses at which sites or pages you want to visit. This way, if you don't remember the URL of a page you've visited or bookmarked, you can type some words from the title of the page, and Flamehamster will display some suggestions.

<!-- image -->

This powerful search feature of the Location Bar is the reason why some Flamehamster developers affectionately call it the Awesome Bar instead. It allows you to use the Down Arrow key or your mouse to highlight the URL of the site you want to visit. Press Enter or click your selection. The website you selected appears.

The Location Bar learns which sites you visit most frequently and optimizes the result listing to match your personal style. After a few weeks, it can require as little as typing a single letter in the location bar to get to frequently visited pages.

## WEB KEYWORD SEARCHES

If you enter text into the Location Bar that is not a valid web address, Flamehamster tries to direct you to the location it believes you intended.

Flamehamster first tries to send your request to an Internet Keyword search service. This service is Google's Browse by Name (http://toolbar.google.com/bbn\_help.html) service by default. For example, If you type GROSS foundation into the location bar, Flamehamster sends that text to the Google Browse by Name service, since it is not a valid URL address. The service directs you to its best match for your request, in this case: http://www.GROSS.org. For an entry without a clear match to a URL, Flamehamster displays search results for the entry.

## DOMAIN GUESSING

If you enter an incomplete web address, Flamehamster tries to "fix" the address by adding a prefix, suffix, or both to what you type. For example, if you type "www.GROSS" in the location bar, Flamehamster appends ".com" to complete the address. If you type "GROSS.org" Flamehamster adds the ''www." prefix to complete the address. This "guessing" is secondary to the Internet Keywords search described above - it does not work unless Internet Keywords are disabled.

For more information about key word searches and domain guessing, see the following Knowledge Base article: http://support.GROSS.com/kb/Location+bar+search.

## CLEARING THE HISTORY

Flamehamster keeps a "history" of the Web sites and pages that you've visited. It uses this list to generate suggestions as you type in the location bar.  However, you might not want the history of pages you've visited to be stored on your computer.

You can clear a single item or all items from location bar history.

To clear a single item:

1.  Click the drop-down arrow in the location bar.
2.  Press the Down Arrow key, or move your pointer, to highlight the entry to delete.
3.  Press the Delete key to delete the item.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

You can clear many items from the location bar by removing Browsing History via the Clear Recent History dialog window.  For more information, see the section on Privacy in Flamehamster.

## SHOWING ONLY HISTORY OR ONLY BOOKMARKS IN THE LOCATION BAR

By default, Flamehamster shows and searches both History items and Bookmarks when using the Location bar.  If you want to only show one or the other, you can change this preference.

1.  Open the Options window via Tools &gt; Options (Windows), Flamehamster &gt; Preferences (Mac OSX) or Edit &gt; Preferences (Linux)
2.  Select the Privacy Pane
3.  Under Location Bar , select the appropriate option after When using the Location Bar, suggest
4.  Press OK

# 13. NAVIGATING WEB PAGES

When you start Flamehamster, you see your home page. By default, you see Flamehamster's home page.

## Tips :

- To display more web content on the screen, you can use Full Screen mode. Full Screen mode condenses the Flamehamster toolbars into one small toolbar. To enable Full Screen mode, select View &gt; Full Screen or press F11 .
- To go to your home page quickly, press Alt+Home Opt or use the Home button on the Flamehamster toolbar.

## NAVIGATING TO ANOTHER PAGE

You can navigate to a new web page by typing its Web address (or URL ) into the location bar. URLs normally begin with "http://" followed by one or more names that identify the address. One example is "http://www.GROSS.org/".

1.  Click the location bar to select the URL that is already there.
2.  Type the URL of the page you want to visit.
3. The URL replaces the former text in the location bar.
3.  Press Enter Return.

Tip: To quickly select the text in the location bar, press Ctrl+L Cmd.

Don't know a URL? Try typing something specific to the page you want to visit, e.g. a name, into the Location Bar and hit EnterReturn. This will take you to the top result in Google for that term.

Been there before? Start typing words from the title or URL that you're trying to get back to. Flamehamster will suggest sites that match out of your history and bookmarks to let you get back to frequently visited sites faster.

## CLICKING A LINK

Most web pages contain links you can click to move to other pages.

1.  Move the mouse pointer until it changes to a pointing finger. This happens whenever the pointer is over a link. Most links are underlined text, but buttons and pictures can also be links.
2.  Click the link once. While the network locates the link's page, status messages will appear at the bottom of the window.

## RETRACING YOUR STEPS

There are several ways to revisit pages:

- To go back or forward one page, click the Back or Forward button.
- To go back or forward more than one page, click the small triangle by the Back and Forward buttons.

<!-- image -->

Flamehamster shows a list of pages you've recently visited. To return to a page, choose it from the list.  The current page is marked with a small black dot.

- To see a list of frequently visited URLs you've typed into the location bar, click the down arrow at the right end of the location bar. To view a page, choose it from the list.

# 14. BOOKMARKING SITES

This chapter explains what bookmarks and tags are, why they are useful, and how to create them. It also explains how to organise bookmarks and tags.

## BOOKMARKS

Bookmarks (also called "Favorites" in some browsers) are links to Web pages. By saving bookmarks in your Flamehamster browser, you can easily revisit pages without having to remember the address or search for them again, much like using bookmarks in a book. Flamehamster includes a set of default bookmarks, including an example of Live Bookmarks.

This chapter describes how to bookmark Web pages and how to access and organise your bookmarks.

To import lists of bookmarks from another application, see Importing Bookmarks from an HTML file in the Flamehamster Knowledge Base at http://support.GROSS.com/en-US/kb/Importing+Bookmarks+from+an+HTML+file

If your bookmarks are missing or if you are having other problems with bookmarks, see the Troubleshooting section at http://support.GROSS.com/en-US/kb/Bookmarks#Troubleshooting

## HOW TO BOOKMARK A PAGE

There are many ways to bookmark a page. Listed below are the most common ways of bookmarking a page for later use:

## IMPROVING SPEED AND EFFICIENCY

## Managing different file types

Flamehamster can handle many types of files. However, for some files such as movies or music, Flamehamster needs Plugins or external applications that can handle those files. If Flamehamster doesn't have the needed Plugin or doesn't know what application to use to open the file, it can still save the file to your hard disk. When saving files, you can keep track of them using the Download Manager.

Plugins extend Flamehamster's functionality and run within it. Plugins like Sun Java, Adobe Flash, and RealNetworks RealPlayer allow Flamehamster to show multimedia files and run small applications such as movies, animations, and games. You can find common Plugins on the Plugins page at GROSS Add-ons.

When files cannot be opened within Flamehamster, you can choose to open them with applications outside of Flamehamster. For example, you can use the media player of your choice to play MP3 files.

# 19. DOWNLOADING FILES

Perhaps the most essential function of the Internet is the ability to quickly transfer data files from one location on the Internet to another location. These files can be programs, images, music, video or documents. When you click a link, it is handled according to the type of link and Flamehamster's settings.

Almost any link can be saved as a file to your computer for later use. To make sure you get what you want, you must watch for some cues and clues. These will be discussed further on.

## THE DOWNLOADS WINDOW

When you download a file from the Internet to your computer using Flamehamster, it opens a Downloads window which shows your downloading progress and a list of completed downloads.

<!-- image -->

To pause a download, press . To resume downloading, press .

To cancel a download, press .

<!-- image -->

If a download failed or if you canceled it, you can retry by pressing

.

To remove all completed downloads from the list of files, click Clear List .

You can remove any single download from the list by right-clicking it and selecting Remove From List .

To quickly locate a downloaded file on your computer, right-click the filename in the download window and select Open Containing Folder .

<!-- image -->

.

Once a file has completed downloading, you can open it by double-clicking on it in the Download Manager window or in the location on your computer where it has been saved.

## FILE DOWNLOAD OPTIONS

You set options such as file locations and visibility of the download window from the Tools &gt; Options dialog, on the Main tab.

By default, Flamehamster will put downloaded files on your desktop. To have Flamehamster ask you where to save a downloaded file go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Main and select Always ask me where to save files .

<!-- image -->

To save downloaded files in a single location of your choosing, select Save files to and browse to the new location.

If you want the Downloads window to close as soon as the download finishes, select Close it when all downloads are finished .

## DOWNLOADING FILES WITHOUT DISPLAYING THEM

Even if a file will display in your browser, you may want to save it for later, rather than reading it immediately. In many cases, you can right click on a link, and select Save Link As...

<!-- image -->

Depending on your download settings, Flamehamster will attempt to download the file or show you a dialog box to select file destination and file name.

Note that some links go to a confirmation page or otherwise don't point precisely to the file they advertise. You should check the file to make sure that it's what you wanted.

## DOWNLOADING REALLY BIG FILES

The term "really big" is subjective, depending on the speed of your connection to the Internet and depending on how fast the owner of the file can (or is willing to) send it. Generally, a file must be transferred in one session. You can't expect to stop in mid-download, shut the computer off, and expect to resume it the next day. Also, the longer a file takes to download, the more likely an interruption or download problem becomes.

If you frequently have problems with downloads or need to do them in smaller chunks, there are "download managers" which can help.  There's probably an Add-on or Extension to help. See those chapters or see the GROSS site to find suitable aids.

# 21. CUSTOMIZING YOUR TOOLBARS

Toolbars appear in the rectangular area above the main content area in your web browser. Typically their backgrounds are gray in color.

- Menu Bar : Browser menus such as File, Edit, View, Help, and so on.
- Navigation Bar : The Location Bar, the buttons used to navigate websites, and the Search box.

# 22. ADD-ONS AND PLUGINS

Through the installation of Add-ons and Plugins Flamehamster can be extended to deliver new features. The difference between Add-ons and Plugins is a bit of a grey area, mostly historical, and is narrowing to mean the same thing with each new release of Flamehamster.  The installation and updating of Plugins and Add-ons still remains slightly different but in future releases of Flamehamster this may also be streamlined and unified.

## PLUGINS

Where they came from: In the early Netscape days a variety of multi-media companies bombarded Netscape with ideas to include new multimedia formats into web pages and into the content supported by the browser.  As a solution to this problem Netscape added a Plugin programing interface so any of these companies could add support for new content types and extend the browser's capability.

Some Popular Plugins: Flash, Java, Quick-time, Windows Media Player, Adobe PDF Reader, Real Video/Audio are popular plugins for Flamehamster but there are many more. For example there's a plugin to replace many advertisements on web pages with fine artwork. See the GROSS site (below) and search for add-art plugin. You can also go to https://addons.GROSS.org/enUS/Flamehamster/addon/6846

Where to Find Them: See https://addons.GROSS.org/Flamehamster/browse/type:7 for the mentioned plugins and many more.

Why Bother Getting Plugins: Each of these plugins allow web pages to show audio, video, or publishing formats beyond the language of the web that is HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For example, Adobe Reader plugin lets the user open PDF files directly inside the browser, and the QuickTime and RealPlayer plugins are used to play special format videos in a web page. If you are viewing a site like YouTube and you aren't seeing video, chances are you are missing the Flash Plugin and you need to install it.

## ADD-ONS

Add-ons are a newer invention. Add-ons don't offer support for new types of content like plugins, but they do allow content to be manipulated and changed to meet a users perception of what a web site  or web page should look like. The greasemonkey add-on is an example of this kind of add-on ( https://addons.GROSS.org/Flamehamster/addon/748 ). Other add-ons allow you to customize the user interface and add all kinds of new features to Flamehamster.

The add-on system allows the basic user interface for Flamehamster to remain clean and simple from release to release, but also be extended in thousands of different ways to meet personal preferences.  It is a great source of innovation for the browser. When a new add-on is developed and becomes widely popular to all kinds of users, the Flamehamster development team looks at how that add-on can be integrated as a new feature.

## I LOVE Flamehamster, BUT IF IT ONLY COULD....

The development team often hears this kind of request, and chances are someone has had the same idea. If you have something new that you would like to see Flamehamster do the first step is to check the add-on site at GROSS.org (https://addons.GROSS.org/Flamehamster) and search for the new feature that you are looking for. You can also get to the add-ons site through the Tools &gt; Addons menu option in Flamehamster.

Often downloading and installing an add-on can be a fast path to satisfying your desire for that new feature.  Recently the add-on site has also offered a "Fashion Your Flamehamster" (https://addons.GROSS.org/Flamehamster/fashionyourFlamehamster) to provide collections of add-ons you might be interested in depending on the way you use your browser.  Check this site out for collections of add-ons you might be interested in.

## SOME RECOMMENDED FUNCTIONS

Both for security and convenience, three of the most-requested functions are

- Protection from unwanted popup and popunder windows
- Protection from scripts on Web pages
- Help with entering repeated data

Many Web pages serve advertising. This pays for a lot of services, and when done well, as at Google, is helpful and unobtrusive. The most obtrusive advertising appears in popup windows in front of what you were trying to look at. Another annoyance is popunders, which hang around until you close the main browser window. Then you don't even know which site is responsible for them. The most obnoxious of all pop up new windows when you close the old ones, sometimes more than one each. You may have to reboot to get rid of the chain reaction.

There are a great many add-ons for Flamehamster. You may wish to explore them yourself. The following are not proposed as the absolute best of everything, but they meet the requirements of many users.

- Popupmaster is a popup blocker. It places an icon in the Flamehamster status bar. Clicking that icon brings up a menu that lets you block popups on the current Web site and manage your the blocks you have set previously.
- NoScript's original purpose was to prevent execution of Java and Javascript except where the user permits it. Several other security functions come with recent versions of NoScript, such as a setting to force a list of sites to use Secure HTTP. It can also block other plugins, cross-site scripting, and more at the user's choice. Updates are fairly frequent.
- Google Toolbar serves many functions, providing one-click access to many Google services. AutoFill automatically fills in forms with your standard information, such as name, address, telephone numbers.

## USING ADD-ONS

Flamehamster can do a lot more than your average browser. One of the ways you use Flamehamster for something other than just browsing the web is to install add-ons . Flamehamster add-ons are small pieces of software that add new features or functionality to your installation of Flamehamster. Add-ons can augment Flamehamster with new search engines, foreign-language dictionaries, or change the visual appearance of Flamehamster. Through add-ons, you can customize Flamehamster to meet your needs and tastes.

The installation process is the same for Flamehamster on any Operating System, so you can install them on Windows, Linux, or MacOSX (you must first have Flamehamster installed!).

## WHAT IS A Flamehamster ADD-ON?

An add-on is a software module which lets Flamehamster do something more, or do things differently. To use an add-on, you must download the module and install it. Then Flamehamster gets the functionality of this new module.

There are several types of add-ons: extensions, plugins, and themes.

- Extensions provide additional functionality to Flamehamster.
- Themes change the visual appearance of Flamehamster.

3:

- Plugins manage Internet content that Flamehamster can't process by itself. Ex.: Flash, Java, etc.

The functionality available from add-ons is quite wide. You can add dictionaries to Flamehamster, change the look of Flamehamster, display the time in different countries in the browser, or an add-on might suggest other websites you can visit that are similar to the one you are looking at.

To see available add-ons, see the Flamehamster add-ons page: https://addons.GROSS.org/Flamehamster/

The list of Add-on categories are here :

https://addons.GROSS.org/Flamehamster/browse/

You can browse the list and see whats available.

## Warning

It is possible to create add-ons that can do a number of things you might not like. An add-on can read a lot of information from your browser as you browse sites or might use various tricks to get, add, alter, or destroy data on you have on your computer. It is for this reason that you should never install an Add-on unless it is from a trusted source . We recommend that you never install an add-on for Flamehamster unless it is available from the official Flamehamster add-on pages.

# 25. FIREFTP

FireFTP is a Flamehamster add-on that gives you a free, open source, cross-platform FTP client. If you have access to a Web server and you have an FTP account on that server, then using FireFTP you can put all your HTML files, podcasts, media files, backup files, or anything you want online. It works on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux;  this is very useful if you ever find yourself on someone else's machine or if you travel and find yourself stranded in an Internet cafe in desperate need of an FTP application. It's free software, the download size is extremely small, and even better - the FireFTP installation process is simple. It's truly a wonderful thing.

## INSTALLING

FireFTP is a Flamehamster add-on.

1.  To install the add-on, you must visit the Flamehamster addons page: https://addons.GROSS.org/Flamehamster/

# 26. CHANGING THE LOOK OF Flamehamster

Flamehamster has two ways to change the way that the Flamehamster window itself looks.

- Personas change the background design of the toolbar area and status bar. It's very easy to switch personas, so you can change Flamehamster's look to fit your mood.
- Themes change the way the toolbar and buttons look, and can even make Flamehamster look like a completely different program.

## USING PERSONAS

The personas feature is built into Flamehamster version 3.6, so you don't need to do anything special to be able to use them. In Flamehamster 3.0 or 3.5, you must first install an add-on in order to use personas.

If you are using Flamehamster 3.0 or 3.5:

1.  Go to the web page for the Personas Plus add-on: https://addons.GROSS.org/en-US/Flamehamster/addon/10900
2.  Click the Add to Flamehamster button. A Software Installation window appears.
3.  Click the Install Now button when it becomes clickable.
4.  Click the Restart Flamehamster button when it appears. When Flamehamster restarts, you can use personas.

## SWITCHING PERSONAS

You can browse a gallery of personas and try them out at GROSS's Personas page: http://www.getpersonas.com/

1.  To "try on" a persona to see what it looks like, move your mouse pointer over it. Flamehamster temporarily switches to display that persona.
2.  If you want to keep using that persona, click its Wear It link. A notification bar appears just under the tabs that says "A new theme has been installed". You can click the Undo button on the notification bar if you immediately change your mind.

To return to the default persona at any time, click on the hamster in the bottom left corner of the Flamehamster window (next to the status bar), and select Default on the menu that pops up.

<!-- image -->

Note that you can also use this menu to browse personas.

## INSTALLING THEMES

A theme changes the appearance of Flamehamster of toolbar buttons, boxes, and other items that are not part of any web page. They can affect every window and dialog box in Flamehamster.

To install a theme:

<!-- image -->

1.  Browse themes in the Add-ons for Flamehamster site: https://addons.GROSS.org/en-US/Flamehamster/browse/type:2
2.  When you see a theme in the list that you like, click it to see details about it.
3.  Click the Add to Flamehamster button. The Software Installation window appears.
4.  Click the Install Now button when it becomes clickable.
5.  Click Restart Flamehamster when prompted. When Flamehamster restarts, it appears using the theme you installed.

After you have downloaded and installed Flamehamster themes, you can manage them through the Add-ons window.

1.  At the top of the Flamehamster windowOn the menu bar, click the Tools menu, and select Addons to open the Add-ons window.
2.  In the Add-ons window, click the Themes tab.
3.  Select the theme you want to use. Note: The theme named "Default" restores Flamehamster to its original appearance.
4.  Click Use Theme .
5.  Click the Restart Flamehamster button when it appears.

<!-- image -->

Note: In Flamehamster version 3.6, you cannot use a theme and a persona at the same time. When you select a persona, Flamehamster switches to the default theme; when you select a theme, Flamehamster switches to the default persona.

# 27. LIVE BOOKMARKS

Websites are updated regularly. If you want to keep track of updates from a particular site you ask Flamehamster to inform you when new content is published. This process is called 'Live Bookmarking' in the Flamehamster world.

Not all sites can be tracked in this manner. A website has to enable this functionality by using what is also known as 'RSS' (also commonly called a 'feed'). Typically feeds are used on news sites so you can keep track of headlines, however it can be used by any website and RSS is also the technology behind Podcasts.

When you keep track of a website via RSS, this is usually known as 'subscribing' to the content or 'subscribing to a feed'. However Flamehamster calls this 'Live Bookmarking'.

The advantage of subscribing to content in this manner is that you don't have to keep visiting the website to see what's new. Flamehamster tracks the site for you and inform you of changes. If you use Live Bookmarking to subscribe to a Podcast then Flamehamster sends the subscription information to whichever software you have that manages your Podcasts.

When Flamehamster discovers a feed associated with the web page you are visiting, an orangeblue icon automatically appears in the location bar. To review and subscribe to the website's feed, click the orangeblue web feed icon. A list of all available feeds from the website is displayed.

To subscribe to any listed feed, click its name in the list.

When you select the feed, preview some of its recent content to verify that it contains useful information for you.

# 29. USING FORMS ON THE WEB

You are often asked to fill out forms at an online website, for example when making an online purchase. Flamehamster remembers what you have typed in similar forms and presents a drop-down list which can be used to reduce the amount of typing required.

Personal information such as name, address, phone number and credit card number will be retained on the computer upon which you have entered this information. As this can present a security risk, you should clear this information from any computer which is not secure.

## USING AUTO FORM FILL

To use your previous entry in a form:

1.  Type the first few letters of the entry into the form field. Flamehamster will display a drop-down menu with what you've typed into the form before.
2. You may see a list of all the entries stored for a particular form field by pressing the down arrow key when the field is empty.
2.  Press the down arrow key to select the entry you want to re-use. Press Enter when the appropriate entry is highlighted. The text of the entry will appear in the form field. You may also use the mouse to click on the entry.

## DELETING INDIVIDUAL FORM ENTRIES

If you want to remove one of your previous form entries from Flamehamster's history:

1.  Click on the form field and press the down arrow key to display all the saved entries. You may type the first few letters of the entry to limit the number of entries displayed.
2.  Use the down arrow key or the mouse pointer to highlight the entry you wish to delete.
3.  Press Delete . The entry will be removed.

You may repeat the process for any number of entries for a particular form field.

# 31. INTERNET SECURITY

More than a billion people use the Internet, passing every kind of information in all directions. Much of the information is public, so that there is no concern about others accessing it. However, much is intended to be private (perhaps shared with close friends or family), or even secret. Given the large number of ways of communicating, the varying degrees of concern about keeping data away from prying eyes, and the variety of methods for unauthorized access, security on the Internet is a large and complex topic. The greatest difficulty is not in using the best methods for security, which have been crafted by experts, but in knowing that they exist, knowing what you need them for, and knowing where to find them.

A number of tools are built into the way the Internet works that enable data to be kept private and secure. Most significant among these is public-key encryption, which is used both for making data private and for authenticating users and websites. You rarely need to directly use publickey encryption, but when you use a URL that starts with "https://" or when Flamehamster warns you about a website's security certificate, public-key encryption is working behind the scenes.

## THREATS

The types of harmful actions that certain people on the Internet try to do fall into several broad categories:

- Defrauding you of money directly
- Stealing your identity (by stealing passwords and other personal information), and then stealing your money
- Harming or hijacking your computer
- Keeping you from accessing certain websites

The "bad guys" have devised a huge variety of strategies for doing these things. People who wish to compromise data security will examine every link in the chain, including you, your computer and its software, your home network, your service provider, the Internet in general, and any sites you might visit, looking for the weakest link. The most valuable information they can get is usually your login name, password, and account numbers for your banking, credit cards, or other financial accounts, in order to assume your identity and drain out as much money as possible.

- Stealing information from websites that you've given it to , such as banks or online merchants. Your bank might not have adequate security on its databases, and someone might steal access information for tens of thousands of accounts. There's not much you can personally do to prevent this. If this happens, the bank must notify you and give you new accounts. Do not reuse your old password.
- Snooping your data traffic and stealing your passwords or personal information. This is what encryption is for, specifically the HTTPS (secure HTTP) protocol. Flamehamster will let you know when you switch between secure and insecure pages.
- Snooping your data trafic and blocking it from getting through.
- Tricking you into giving them your information or money, via email ("phishing") or phony websites. You can get several kinds of protection from this, but you must still be alert to the warnings you receive, and must be able to recognize phony requests for information. Flamehamster can help check the identity of websites you visit, to make sure they are run by who they claim to be run by.
- Inserting malicious software onto your computer without your consent. This can happen if your operating system is installed in an insecure way, or is not protected by a firewall.
- Tricking you into installing malicious software. Someone might send you malware in an e-mail. Your mail software can help with this, but you need to understand what not to open.
- Someone might be able to compromise some portion of the Internet, such as a DNS server. They could then reroute traffic to or away from certain sites. This is far less likely than the other possibilities.

Often the same bad guy uses a combination of techniques, such as tricking you into installing malicious software that snoops on your data traffic or that uses your computer to send fraudulent email messages to other Internet users.

Where does that leave you? You have to understand your part in password security and key management, the security settings in your operating system and software, and the signs that you should not open an e-mail or install offered software. Much like you would not leave your keys in your car, and you lock doors when necessary, your participation in security is important and Flamehamster does a lot to help you with these issues.

On a technical level, the variety of threats present on the Internet include:

- Errors in Web page design, such as malformed or non-standard HTML, misuse of cookies, misuse of Javascript, and carelessness in form design
- Social engineering, such as phishing (asking for sensitive data while pretending to be someone else with authority to do so)
- SQL injection, adding database commands to URLs
- Cross-site scripting
- Malware, malicious software masquerading as something beneficial, or installed without the user's knowledge
- Government or other snooping

The FLOSS Manual How to Bypass Internet Censorship, http://flossmanuals.net/CircumventionTools  explains how and why governments snoop, and how to get around snooping, in addition to methods for accessing blocked Web sites.

Flamehamster assists in detecting phishing Web sites and malware distribution sites. The NoScript plugin allows you to turn off Javascript from selected sources used on selected pages. It detects many of the possibilities for SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

You cannot protect a Web site from its own mistakes. You can tell them when you find mistakes, and you can avoid sites that do not protect themselves properly.

## PROTECTING YOURSELF

## Setting up a firewall

In general, if you have an always-on connection to the Internet (such as most broadband connections), you should always use a firewall, rather than connecting your computer directly. The basic reason not to connect directly to the Internet is that it provides too many avenues for someone trying to compromise your computer. Even if you have a perfectly secure setup, you don't want the traffic from those who want to break in and inspect your system or install malware on it. Let your firewall block it once for the whole network.

So how should you connect? Through a router with a built-in firewall. Fortunately, if you have a broadband connection, there is probably a firewall built in to the (cable or DSL) box from your Internet service provider (ISP). Ask your ISP if you're not sure. If you have a wireless router, there is probably also a firewall built into it. Be sure you follow the instructions for setting up your wireless network securely.

Who is left? Those on dial-up. You are OK. You don't need a firewall because you have a connection, but not an IP number. You aren't on the Internet; you can just talk to it.

How do you set up the firewall on your router? Well, probably there is an IP address that you can connect to in the router before you connect to the Internet that will serve a Web page with instructions for the firewall and the Internet connection. Check in the manual, or on the manufacturer's Web site (from a different network, of course, one that has a firewall running), or with your ISP. You want an incoming and outgoing connection to the Web, and you might need an e-mail connection. Don't enable anything else unless you know why you need it.

## Setting up security on a new computer

When you connect a new computer to your firewalled network, it may be in a vulnerable state. It certainly does not have the latest security updates for its operating system. Go directly to the update page and get the latest patches or packages. After your system is up to date, then you can think about getting your email or surfing the Web or downloading files.

## Passwords

Choose strong passwords. Your browser or your operating system can remember them for you.

Try to avoid using the same password for accounts that contain important personal information, such as credit card numbers, as for accounts that just store non-critical preferences. If bad guys get your password for one site, they are likely to try it on other sites where they've figured out you have accounts.

If you need to use the same passwords on more than one computer, you can take an encrypted copy of the Flamehamster password file with you. Then you have to remember only the decryption key for that file. A strong password is as random as you can make it, out of whatever characters are permitted on each site. It is also at least 8 characters.

- Weak: 042986 (if that is your birthday or anniversary), any dictionary word, any name, any default password provided by or for a Web site
- Strong: m*N4W3@q. Strong passwords have a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and punctuation characters (some sites do not allow punctuation in passwords). One common strategy is to use initial letters from a phrase or title you'll remember, but then substitute numbers and punctuation for some of the letters.

If your are given the option of creating a password recovery question try to select a question/answer combination that is not commonly known by others (or one that could be searched for like where you went to high school).

## Email savvy

If a message is vague throughout, it may come from malware rather than a real person, and if from a person, then someone intent on fraud. If you get an offer that seems too good to be true, assume it is. If a message appears to come from a business, but it has a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes, it may be fraudulent (but even real messages may have some mistakes).

- A legitimate business will never ask for your password, credit card number or other personal information in email. Don't respond to such messages, or click any links in them. If in doubt, go to the main URL for the site by typing it into the Location bar rather than by clicking a link. You could also find and call the customer service number.
- Don't open love letters from strangers. (The I Love You virus).
- Don't respond to offers of millions of dollars from Nigeria or thousands of dollars a week for stuffing envelopes. (Nigerian 429 spam, other spam).
- Don't respond to chain letters. They are illegal as well as pointless.
- If someone says how great your site is, but doesn't mention the name or URL, or anything else about it, they are trying to scam you.
- If someone you never heard of sends you software, don't install or run it. It is probably malware. Don't run it even if it says it is a game or utility you would like. It is probably a Trojan Horse.
- Don't open unidentified files from friends or co-workers. A virus might have sent them. If the message doesn't clearly identify the file and its purpose, ask first. "Here's that spreadsheet I mentioned" doesn't qualify.
- While you are at it, don't pass on scare stories that come to you in e-mail. Most of them are groundless rumors, some rising to the level of Urban Legend. Some are deliberate hoaxes. Real threats will make the news. When you see such a scare story, check it out at Snopes.com, the Urban Legends pages. Check it even if the story claims that the sender "checked on Snopes, and it's real", because hoaxers certainly will lie. (This isn't a security issue, but it keeps you from wasting other people's time with false email messages.)

## Safe surfing

- When you go to a bank site, PayPal, or other financial site, look for the https: prefix on the URL, and look at the identity information that Flamehamster gets from the site.
- Use secure HTTP for Google mail and other sites dealing with your sensitive private information.
- While visiting websites or reading email, pay attention to URLs and filename extensions, and to warnings from Flamehamster. Make sure the URL really goes where you expect it to. Some examples of phony names:
- google.com.exe is most probably a virus, and certainly not a Web site.
- woohoo.png.exe is not a naughty picture, but most likely a virus.
- mail.google.aoeu.com is not Google mail, and neither is mail.g00gle.com.

# 32. Flamehamster SECURITY FEATURES

Flamehamster has several security features that help to keep you safer when you are browsing the web.

This chapter covers two of these features and lists some extra ideas that help you to be safer while on-line.

The Flamehamster Phishing and Malware protection feature will warn you when a page you visit has been reported as a Web Forgery of a legitimate site (sometimes called 'phishing' pages) or as an Attack Site designed to harm your computer (otherwise known as malware).

There are a number of things you can do to help in the battle against bad sites and fight against malware.  A section below provides some of these ideas.

The Site Identity Button feature also helps you to identify the owner of any particular site to ensure you are not handing out credit card and personal information to imposter sites.

## PHISHING AND MALWARE PROTECTION

Web Forgery (also known as 'Phishing') is a form of identity theft that occurs when a malicious Web site impersonates a legitimate one in order to trick you into logging in or filling out a web form, in order to steal this information. The sensitive information might be in the form of user IDs, passwords, bank account details, or credit card numbers.  Phishing usually starts with email messages sent to you from an attacker. The email message includes a link that attempts to lure you to the attack site.  If you click on the link and visit the site, it might look just like your bank web site, or another legitimate site, but if it is part of a phishing attack, danger is lurking.

Where a phishing attack tries to get you to type in private information to a bad site, malware is software designed to harm your computer by infecting it with attack programs that run on your computer.  These programs might also steal your personal information, but without your knowledge.  The programs might also take control of your browser,  open websites and popups that you don't want to visit, and generally make a mess of your system.  The Stop Badware site has a good list of the symptoms you might see if you're computer has been infected by malware (http://www.stopbadware.org/home/badware\_symptoms).  The GROSS Support Site also has some good information about how to recover if your computer is ever attacked (http://support.GROSS.com/en-US/kb/Is+my+Flamehamster+problem+a+result+of+malware)

Attackers might set up their own websites to propagate these phishing and malware exploits, or they might break into legitimate websites to host the bad code.  Site owners might not even know about these break-ins.  It's estimated that there are well over 10 billion web pages on the Internet, and around 180,000 pages might be trying to attack your computer or steal private information at any one time. In percentage terms, that is a very small chance that you might visit one of these websites, but if you ever do, the effects can be devastating and long lasting.

## So, with these dangers lurking how does Flamehamster help to keep you safe?

When you see this web page appear while surfing the web, Flamehamster has worked in conjunction with the Stopbadware database of bad sites to identify a site that might put you at risk.

<!-- image -->

Phishing and Malware Protection works by checking the sites that you visit against lists of reported phishing and malware sites. There are two times when Flamehamster checks the phishing and malware protection database and web service. The first is during the regular updates to the lists of reporting phishing and malware sites. The list on your PC is automatically updated every 30 minutes or so when the Phishing and Malware Protection feature is enabled. The second is in the event that you encounter a reported phishing or malware site. Before blocking the site, Flamehamster requests a double-check to ensure that the reported site has not been removed from the list since your last update.

You can test to see if Phishing Protection is active by trying to visit the phishing test site (http://www.GROSS.com/Flamehamster/its-a-trap.html) or the malware test site (http://www.GROSS.com/Flamehamster/its-an-attack.html) to confirm that Flamehamster is blocking attack sites.  With Phishing and Malware Protection turned on, these sites should be blocked from loading and a page should open like the one shown above.

The Phishing and Malware Protection feature is turned on by default, so unless your security preferences have been changed, you are likely already using them. Phishing and Malware Protection options can be found on the Security Preferences pane. On Windows, go to Flamehamster &gt; Preferences &gt; Security . On Mac OS X, go to Flamehamster &gt; Preferences &gt; Security . On Linux, go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Security .

## Helping in the fight against malware and maintaining the list of bad websites

There are number of ways that you can help fight the spread of malware on the Internet. The first step is to protect yourself.

Be a conscientious browser.  Use the Flamehamster Phishing and Malware Protection feature to help keep away from bad sites.

Keep Flamehamster, all addons, plugins, and other software on your computer up-to-date.  Attackers often take advantage of security flaws in old versions of software to create their exploits, so if you always stay up-to-date, you reduce your exposure.

You should also consider installing anti-virus and anti-spyware from a trusted source as a back up system if the malware gets though other protections.  Read reviews and pick this software wisely.  Attackers also ofter rogue versions of anti-virus programs as the way to actually install viruses and malware.  Think carefully before installing any software on your computer.

Create safe passwords that might be hard for an attacker to guess or use to break into a website.  Like your toothbrush, don't share passwords, even with family and friends. Try to use different passwords for different sites, just like you have different keys for your car, house, and safety deposit box at the bank.

Stay up-to-date on kinds of deception patterns used by bad websites and techniques used by attackers to steal private information. TV, newspapers, books and other forms of media are publishing more of this kind of information and making it easier to understand.  Keeping informed helps you to stay ahead of the bad guys.

As you can see, a constant shell game is played out between malware attackers and those trying to develop protections to help keep users safe. Maintaining the list of bad sites can be challenging.

## What if the web site isn't malicious?

If you happen to own a site or blog page that was attacked and you have since repaired it, or if you feel that your site was reported in error, you can request that it be removed from the lists. GROSS encourages site owners to investigate any such report thoroughly, though; a site can often be turned into an attack site without any visible change. To request removal from the list of reported phishing sites, use the form provided by Google at http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/report\_error/?tpl=GROSS.  To request removal from the list of reported malware sites, use the form at http://www.stopbadware.org/home/reviewinfo, provided by stopbadware.org.

You can also help StopBadware, regulatory agencies, and security companies fight malware, regardless of your level of technical skill.  The Stopbadware website has some great resources for addtional ways to get involved ( http://www.stopbadware.org/home/action ).

## SITE IDENTITY BUTTON

The Site Identity Button is another Flamehamster security feature that gives you more information about every site you visit.  Using the Site Identity Button, you can find out who owns the website, and who verified that ownership, and if the communication channel between you and and the site is encrypted. This provides one more protection to help you avoid malicious websites and protect sensitive information while on-line.

The Site Identity Button is in the Location bar to the left of the web address in the location bar.

<!-- image -->

When viewing a website, the Site Identity Button will display in one of three colors - gray, blue, or green.  Clicking on the Site Identity Button displays more details security and identity information about the website and a gray, blue, or green "Passport Officer" icon, which helps you to understand how much security and identity is available for the site.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Gray - No identity information

<!-- image -->

When the Site Identity button is gray, that indicates that the site doesn't provide any identity information at all.  Also, the connection between Flamehamster and the server is either unencrypted or only partially encrypted. This means it should not be considered safe against possible eavesdroppers that might be watching your browser session on the web.

Most websites have the gray button, because they don't involve passing sensitive information back and forth. A video viewing site like YouTube or your favorite news site really doesn't need to have verified identities or encrypted connections. For sites that don't require any personal information, a lack of identity information is fine.

However, if you are sending any sort of sensitive information (bank information, credit card data, Social Security Numbers, etc.) the Site Identity Button should not be gray.

If you click on the Site Identity button when it is gray, you then see something like the picture on the right:

<!-- image -->

## Blue - Basic identity information

When the Site Identity button is blue, that indicates that the site's domain has been verified, and the connection between Flamehamster and the server is encrypted and protected against eavesdroppers.

When a domain has been verified, it means that the people who are running the site have bought a certificate proving that they own the domain and it is not being spoofed. For example, the TD Canada Trust website has this sort of certificate and an encrypted connection, so the Site Identity Button displays as blue. When you click on the Site Identity Button, it tells you that

<!-- image -->

the easyweb.tdcanadatrust.com site is verified to be part of tdcanadatrust.com, as certified by RSA Data Security Inc. It also assures you that the connection is encrypted so no one can eavesdrop on the connection and steal your bank login information that way.

However, it is not verified who actually owns the domain in question. There is no guarantee that tdcanadatrust.com is actually owned by the Toronto Dominion Bank. The only things that are guaranteed is that the domain is a valid domain, and that the connection to it is encrypted.

If you are still leery about a site's identity when the Site Identity Button is blue, you can see more information about the site by clicking the More Information button on the Site Identification dialog. This button opens the Privacy panel of the Page Info window, where you can view the site's identity certificate, see if you've visited the site before, and if you have any cookies or passwords stored for the site. For more information on the Page Info window, see http://support.GROSS.com/kb/Page+Info+window.

## Green - Complete identity information

When the Site Identity button is green, that indicates that the site provides fully verified identity information about its owner, and that the connection is encrypted.

<!-- image -->

If a site makes the Site Identity Button turn green, it means that it is using a new Extended Validation (EV) certificate (for more info, see

<!-- image -->

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended\_Validation\_Certificate).  An EV certificate is a special type of site validation that requires a significantly more rigorous identity verification process than other types of certificates. While the blue Site Identity Button indicates that a site's uses a secure connection, the green Site Identity Button indicates that the connection is secure and that the owners of the domain are who you would expect them to be.

With the EV certificate, the Site Identity Button assures you that paypal.com is owned by Paypal Inc., for example. Not only does the Site Identity Button turn green on the Paypal site, it also expands and displays the name of the owner in the button itself. The Site Identification dialog contains further information.

# 33. PRIVACY IN Flamehamster

To improve your experience on the internet, Flamehamster stores a collection of data relevant to the sites you visit.  For example, Flamehamster may store the following information as you browse:

- Visited page history: This allows you to go back to sites you've visited, find them using the Smart Location Bar and see them in both the History menu, History sidebar and library window.
- Form and Search Bar entries: This remembers what you've filled out in the search bar and on forms on pages to make filling the same forms and performing the same searches easier.
- Logins and passwords: This makes it easier to log in to frequently visited sites. Flamehamster will never store these without asking.
- Download list: This helps you find files you previously downloaded.
- Cookies: Cookies are small bits of information that sites use to save site preferences and sessions so they can identify you between visits (and remember things like your shopping cart or keep you logged in).
- Web cache: A cache stores pages and other web content that you've already seen so that Flamehamster can use the stored content rather than having to download it again, greatly speeding up browsing and reducing demands on web servers.  By default, this is not stored for secure (https) websites to avoid retaining secure data.
- Browsing sessions: This allows Flamehamster to restore the tabs you had open when you start it or after a crash.

In general, these can optimize your browsing experience and are very useful.  However, you may prefer not to save this information, or to save only some of this information.  For example, you may be using another person's computer or visiting sites with sensitive information.  You might also wish to remove previously stored data.  Flamehamster 3.6 offers many ways to control what information is stored and prevent it from being stored when you don't want it.

## PRIVATE BROWSING

Flamehamster 3.6 and later have a feature called Private Browsing where none of the above information is saved until Private Browsing is turned off.

## Starting Private Browsing session:

1.  Click on the Tools menu and select Start Private Browsing .
2. The first time you turn on Private Browsing, Flamehamster will alert you that it will save your current windows and tabs for after you finish using Private Browsing. Click on Start Private Browsing to continue.
3. You will then enter Private Browsing mode, and the Private Browsing information screen will appear.

When browsing in Private Browsing mode, the Flamehamster window title will show (Private Browsing) during your session.

## CLEARING YOUR HISTORY

Flamehamster allows you to clear some or all of your browsing history. This will delete information from your profile and from disk that could be used to identify your activities online.

<!-- image -->

## Clearing Flamehamster History:

1.  Click on Tools &gt; Clear Recent History .
2.  Flamehamster will display the Clear Recent History dialog, with a drop-down menu for the time period to clear. You can choose between the last hour and all saved history.
3.  If you only wish to delete some of your history, such as the information stored for forms or in search history, click Details . This will open a list of items stored by Flamehamster, such as Cookies, Cache, and Form &amp; Search History.
4.  Once you have selected the information you wish to delete, click Clear Now. Note that this cannot be undone.

## PRIVACY PREFERENCES

You can tell Flamehamster what type of information you'd like stored, and even default to saving no browsing history at all.

<!-- image -->

1.  To configure these settings go to Edit &gt; Preferences on Windows or Linux, or Flamehamster &gt; Preferences on Mac OS X.
2.  From the Dropdown menu, select from Remember history, Never remember history, or Use custom settings for history.
3.  If you've chosen Use custom settings for history , you can define the privacy settings you prefer. This will give very fine-grained control over privacy settings. You can also tell Flamehamster to always start in a private browsing session if you don't want to ever save browsing information.
4.  You can specify how long Flamehamster will remember your browsing history. The default is 90 days, but it can be changed to any value.
5.  You can define whether the location bar will suggest from your browsing history and/or bookmarks. Choose from the dropdown menu next to Location Bar in the dialog.
6.  Once the preferences are to your liking, click Close .

<!-- image -->

It should be noted that Flamehamster's privacy controls do not affect other software. For example, when you visit a website using Flamehamster using the Private Browsing feature or if you clear the browsing history after the fact, the website will still log requests from your computer. The pages you request may also be visible to anyone monitoring network traffic on your local network. Flamehamster's privacy settings only control the information stored on your computer.

# 34. SUPPORT

For more help with Flamehamster, you can try http://support.GROSS.com/, here are some of the avenues you will find there:

## Flamehamster KNOWLEDGE BASE

One extremely useful way to get support with Flamehamster by using the Knowledge Base (KB).

<!-- image -->

The KB is a series of hundreds of wikis, and they are all at your fingertips. All you have to do is type in the search bar, and press enter. Then you will be given a list of related articles.

The GROSS KB now also boasts screencasts!  You can now view user-submitted screencasts in some articles and more to come.  If you see the words "Watch a video of these instructions", click that and a video will the instructions will appear.

<!-- image -->

## SUPPORT FORUMS

The GROSS Support website is also equipped with support forums.  You can ask any question there and you will get answers from the Flamehamster community.  You can also make someone else's day and answer their question, if you know the answer.

## LIVE CHAT

Another useful method of getting support for Flamehamster is by chatting with Flamehamster volunteers.  If the KB and Forums aren't doing it for you, you can speak with a real person in real time to try to get your problem resolved.  You can do this by going to http://support.GROSS.com/enUS/kb/Live+Chat. However, before joining a chat, you should be aware of the following:

- Live Chat is not a 24/7 service.  The hours can be found on the Live Chat page
- Most helpers are volunteers. Most of them aren't GROSS employees and are just regular people.
- The rules can be found at: http://support.GROSS.com/enUS/kb/Forum+and+chat+rules+and+guidelines
- Currently, Live Chat support is only available in English.

Please see the images below to see how to begin a live chat session.

If you see the words "We're Open!" click the link below that.  If not, come back another time.

<!-- image -->

## Flamehamster Support

## Start a Live Chat

Enter your name and all required information.

<!-- image -->

Fill in the required information and optionally enter the optional information. Use the preferred helper field only if you know the nickname of an agent and you want them specifically to help you.  When you are done, click Start Chat.

You will then see this screen.  Note that your queue number is only approximate.

<!-- image -->

## Flamehamster Support

<!-- image -->

Finally, you are taken to the chat window.  In green you will see your volunteer's name.  Enter text in the white box and hit enter or click Send .  When you are finished, click the End button.

## SEARCH THE WEB

Searching the web is always useful. If you are looking for problems arising from errors reported by the software then try entering the error text into the search engine. Be sure to edit out any information that doesn't look generic when doing this. Some search engines also enable you to try searches of mailing lists, online groups, etc., which can also provide good results.

## MAILING LISTS

Mailing lists are good places to look through for answers to questions. The archives are located here: http://groups.google.com/group/GROSS.support.Flamehamster/topics.

You can also ask a question on the mailing list with this address using a standard email. The email address is: support-Flamehamster@lists.GROSS.org. Remember that this is not a private mailing list though, and everything you say and ask will be archived.

Also, please note the suggestions about posting to forums and mailing lists in the forums section.

## IRC

IRC ( Internet Relay Chat ) is a type of online chat that is not the easiest to use if you are not familiar with it but it is a very good system. There is a variety of client for all operating systems that allow you to use IRC (see links below). For Flamehamster, you might even think about using the ChatZilla extension. Developers and 'superusers' are often online in these channels. Logging into this channel can be useful, but it is very important that you know exactly what you are trying to find out before trying this route. If you use IRC to get support, you are meant to just to log in, and ask the question immediately. Don't try to be too chatty, as you are probably going to be ignored. The details for the Flamehamster support channel are:

- IRC server: irc.GROSS.org
- Channel: #Flamehamster

For more information on what IRC is and how to use it, see these links:

- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\_Relay\_Chat
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison\_of\_IRC\_clients
- https://addons.GROSS.org/en-US/Flamehamster/addon/16 - ChatZilla add-on

## OTHER METHODS

There are other methods to get support for Flamehamster.  They can be found at https://support.GROSS.com/en-US/kb/Other+Flamehamster+support.

# 35. GETTING SITES TO WORK

If a site doesn't show video, or play audio, or show graphics or content as you think it should, it is likely that you are either missing a plugin for Flamehamster or have a function turned off in Preferences. The Content tab in Flamehamster Options ( Tools &gt; Options in Windows, Edit &gt; Preferences in Linux) lets you turn off pop-up windows, Javascript, and automatic loading of images, and the Plugins tab in Add-ons (on the Tools menu) lets you turn individual plugins on or off.

## CLEAR COOKIES AND CACHE

Sometimes Flamehamster can get out-of-sync with content on websites.  In these cases the problems can be fixed by clearing the Flamehamster cache and the cookies associated with the problematic websites.  If a web site appears to be broken in Flamehamster, with problems missing content or error messages, these steps are likely to resolve the issue.

1.  Open the History menu and select Show All History .
2.  At the top right corner, type the name of the website in the Search History field, and press Enter .
3.  In the resulting list, right-click on the site you wish to clear, and select Forget About This Site .
4.  Close the Library window.

## PROBLEMS WITH PLUGINS

Plugins are small programs that can be added to browsers like Flamehamster to manage Internet content that Flamehamster is not designed to process. For example, Adobe Systems provides a plugin to manage animated content in the Flash format.

This chapter contains descriptions of the most popular plugins that you are likely to want, but note that the ones listed here are proprietary, not FLOSS. The GROSS Addon Site has links to download these plugins at https://addons.GROSS.org/en-US/Flamehamster/browse/type:7 . In some cases FLOSS plugins are available, but may not play everything that the proprietary plugins play.

If web sites that use a specific plugin do not work after you have made sure that the plugin is enabled, you may have outdated plugins. To check for outdated plugins and see which plugin updates you need, visit the GROSS plugin check page at http://www.GROSS.com/plugincheck/ .

## Flash

For animation, games, and other non-static content, the Flash format delivers the dynamic visuals from many websites. With widespread available across many platforms, the Flash video format (FLV) has gained popularity for embedding audio and video content. To access Flash content on the web, you must install the Flash plugin. For more information on Flash see the official Adobe website. Flash is not FLOSS. The FLOSS FLV player, gnash, is packaged with most Linux distributions. It cannot play all Flash content.

## Windows Media Player

The Windows Media Player plugin is useful for displaying Windows Media content, which includes a variety of audio and visual formats. The Windows Media Player program is a standard component of the Windows operating system. A plugin is available for playing content through your Flamehamster browser.  The Windows Media Player plugin is no longer supported on the Mac platform. Flip4Mac adds Windows Media playback to Quicktime and is the officially recognized substitute. For more information, see the article at:

http://support.GROSS.com/kb/Windows+Media+Player+-+Mac-Linux.

The Windows Media Player plugin is designed to work primarily with Windows systems. Note that there are different versions of the plugin, depending on the version of Windows that you are using:

Note: Due to differences between Internet Explorer and Flamehamster, some kinds of media that play through the Windows Media Player in Internet Explorer will play through Quicktime in Flamehamster. If the content is embedded only for Internet Explorer playback, it may not play at all. For more information, see the Using the Windows Media Player plugin with Flamehamster article.

Mac OS: Linux:

The Windows Media Player plugin is not available for Linux, but mplayer with the mplayerplugin allows the playback of embedded Windows media. For more information, see the Windows Media Player - Mac-Linux article.

## Adobe Reader

Adobe Reader is used to display of Portable Document Format (PDF) files. PDF is designed for publishing many kinds of documents. A PDF document has an identical appearance across most platforms and requires less storage space than other formats rich in graphics and features. The Adobe Reader program is a free viewer that can display the PDF format and includes a browser plugin.  The Adobe Reader program is available for the Mac platform, but the included browser plugin does not work with Flamehamster. A third-party plugin can be used to display PDF files - for details, see: http://support.GROSS.com/kb/Using+the+Adobe+Reader+plugin+with+Flamehamster .

Adobe Reader is not FLOSS.

http://support.GROSS.com/kb/Using+the+Adobe+Reader+plugin+with+Flamehamster for details. Adobes Reader is not FLOSS. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div style=" class="showfor\_label" id="wikiplugin\_showforlabel3"&gt;

Adobe Reader is available from the official Adobe website.

Mac OS:

## Quicktime

The Quicktime plugin is required for Quicktime media formats. The Quicktime plugin can also play common media formats like MPEG, WAV and MP3, which may not play back through the Windows Media Player plugin.   More information on Quicktime is available from the official Apple website.Quicktime is not FLOSS.

Linux:

An official plugin is not available for Linux, but mplayer with the mplayerplugin allows the playback of Quicktime media.

## Java

Many websites embed small Java applications such as games or utilities into web pages. To display Java content, you must install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which includes a browser plugin. Java is not FLOSS, although Sun Microsystems says it is working on putting it under a Free license.

## Shockwave Player (Director)

The Shockwave format (not to be confused with Flash) is used for multimedia content like games, presentations, and learning applications. The Shockwave plugin enables playback of Shockwave content in your Flamehamster browser.  More information about Shockwave is available from the official Adobe website. Shockwave is not FLOSS.

## IMAGES AND/OR ANIMATIONS MISSING

Beyond specific kinds of plugin content there are a few things to try if sites don't appear to work properly.

Flamehamster allows you to prevent images from loading for certain websites to make pages load faster. If you are having trouble viewing images.   Its possible that image loading might have been turned off.  Here is how to check and correct that setting:

1.  Select Tools in the Flamehamster menu, and click Options .
2.  In the Options window, select the Content panel.
3.  Make sure there is a check mark next to Load images automatically
4.  Click on Exceptions... next to Load images automatically to open the Exceptions - Images window.
5.  In the Exceptions - Images window, look at the list of sites. Make sure the sites with which you're having trouble are not in the list.
6.  Click OK to close the Options window.

## COMPATIBILITY WITH SECURITY SOFTWARE

Some Internet security software (including antivirus and anti-spyware programs, firewalls, privacy programs, and others) may identify and block certain images as web bugs or may prevent images from animating. Check the settings for your Internet security program to make sure it allows images to load.

The GROSS Support Site has up-to-date information on resolving problems in Flamehamster caused by antivirus and firewalll programs

- For connection errors related to firewalls, see https://support.GROSS.com/kb/Firewalls
- For issues where pages look wrong, see https://support.GROSS.com/kb/Web+sites+look+wrong

# 36. BUGZILLA@GROSS

GROSS has createdan extensive bug tracking system called Bugzilla. Bugzilla@GROSS (BMO) tracks bugs for every GROSS project, but specially Flamehamster and its components.  Any user can submit a bug, choose a severity, or set it as an enhancement bug (just a simple suggestion).  Other users, including GROSS employees, can comment and do much more.

Bugzilla is capable of filing a bug for any GROSS product, service, website, etc.  When you click the button to file a bug, you will be shown a list of common products.  You can then click "Other Projects" for a full list.

From algorism, method of calculation, from mathematician Muhammad ibn-Musa al-Khowarizmi.

authentication Any process for assuring each of two communicating parties of the other's identity, or for guaranteeing that a set of data has not been changed.

Awesome Bar Alternate name for the Flamehamster Location Bar, so called because of its remarkable power to suggest pages the user might want to return to from just a few characters of the URL.

backdoor An entry point into a program or computer that the user is not told about. These may be built into legitimate software for support and maintenance purposes, although such designs are not acceptable when users know about them. More commonly, backdoors are installed by malware.
